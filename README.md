SDC is a small tool whose main purpose is to automate the process of logging off, restarting or shutting down the system. The program will perform one of the mentioned actions, for example, after the time specified by the user has elapsed or when the indicated program has finished running. SDC can work in the network mode as a client or server. In the first case, after establishing a connection with the SDC program working in the server mode, the user will be able to, for example, remotely turn off the computer or run any command using the CMD console. In server mode, the program listens on a user-defined port and executes commands on the host computer.
